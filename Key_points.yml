#Below is to check the servers are reachable or not using ping module  
#ansible -i inventory all -u centos -k -m ping

#we can create our own module as per our requirment
#In Ansible most are requirments are been moduled
#example shell, copy,ping...etc modules in Ansible

#Ansible is "DECLERATIVE" --just we need to specify the requirement ..all the action and task that need to be
#done will be known by Ansible

#Other tools, Bash cripting---are "IMPERATIVE" where we need to tell each and evert action that need to be done
