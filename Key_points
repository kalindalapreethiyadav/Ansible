Below is to check the servers are reachable or not using ping module  
-->ansible -i inventory all -u centos -k -m ping

we can create our own module as per our requirment
In Ansible most are requirments are been moduled
example : shell, copy,ping...etc modules in Ansible

Ansible is "DECLERATIVE" --just we need to specify the requirement ..all the action and task that need to be
done will be known by Ansible

Other tools, Bash cripting---are "IMPERATIVE" where we need to tell each and evert action that need to be done

Ansible can be used(operated) in 2 Mode(Types) :-
1. Manual Approach (Single command)
2. Automated Approach (play books:YAML/YML)

#Play BOOKs is also a script that can be automated as per requirment.

Play Books is which contains lots of Plays
JSON,HTML,HTML%,Javascriptlike this YAML --ia also a Mark up language to repesent the data.
Yet Another Markup language(YAML) ---easy to understand & popular.

INDENTATION ---- uniform spacing & tab spaces are not allowed in YAML.

Extenstion:-
-YAML 
-YML
Both are same

YAML is most important below two things:-

1) Dictionary -- A key is having a value pair (ex: Name:preethi) "KEY:vALUE"
2) Lists -- A key having mutiple values pairs
Ex: Teams:
       -AM
       -AD
