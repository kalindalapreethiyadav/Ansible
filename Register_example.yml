      debug:
          msg: "{{ OUT.stdout }}"   #In MSG, IF variable starts first then should be in "" then it works.

#OUT is jsut a varible we are storing it can be anything 
#Above we are printing only "standard ouput in the data which we registered" , not std error,cmd,failed ..etc
#Register -->used to take output and can be use anywhere where required
